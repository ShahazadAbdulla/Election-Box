🗳️ Election Box – Secure Fingerprint-Based Voting System
🔹 Overview
Election Box is a biometric-based electronic voting system that ensures a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof electoral process. Using fingerprint authentication, a keypad interface, and an LCD display, this system eliminates multiple voting fraud by allowing each registered voter to cast only one vote. Once a vote is cast, the fingerprint data is deleted, ensuring a one-person, one-vote policy.

🔹 Features
✅ Fingerprint Authentication – Uses a biometric fingerprint sensor for secure voter identification.
✅ Admin-Controlled System – PIN-protected access for enrollment, voting, and result viewing.
✅ Real-Time Vote Counting – Displays live election results.
✅ Secure & Tamper-Proof – Deletes fingerprint after voting to prevent multiple votes.
✅ User-Friendly Keypad Interface – Simple navigation for both voters and administrators.
✅ LCD Display – Provides clear feedback and instructions.
✅ Standalone System – Works without the need for a network or external database.
✅ Component Testing Scripts – Separate test programs for fingerprint sensor, keypad, and LCD.

🔹 Hardware Used
Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor – Captures and verifies fingerprints.
4x4 Keypad – Used for entering PINs and selecting options.
I2C LCD Display (HW-61) – Provides real-time system updates.
Arduino (or compatible microcontroller) – Processes voter authentication and results.
🔹 Required Libraries
Make sure you have the following libraries installed in Arduino IDE:

cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <Adafruit_Fingerprint.h>  // Fingerprint Sensor Library
#include <Keypad.h>                // Keypad Library
#include <Wire.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>      // LCD Display Library
How to Install:
Open Arduino IDE
Go to Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries
Search for the required library and click Install

🔹 How It Works
1️⃣ Admin Login – The system starts in admin mode, requiring a PIN (0000) for access.
2️⃣ Enrollment – Admin can register new voters by scanning and saving their fingerprints.
3️⃣ Voting – Voters authenticate using their fingerprint and cast their vote.
4️⃣ Vote Security – After voting, the system deletes the voter’s fingerprint to prevent re-voting.
5️⃣ Results Display – Admin can check election results at any time.

🔹 Testing the Components
Before running the main voting system, test each hardware component using the provided test scripts:

✅ Test the Fingerprint Sensor

Open test/FingerPrintTest/FingerPrintTest.ino in Arduino IDE
Upload and check if fingerprints are recognized correctly
✅ Test the Keypad

Open test/KeyPadTesting/KeyPadTesting.ino
Press keys and monitor the serial output
✅ Test the LCD Display

Open test/LCDTest/LCDTest.ino
Ensure the LCD displays text properly
🔹 How to Upload & Run
Clone the Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ShahazadAbdulla/Election-Box.git
Open in Arduino IDE
Open Arduino IDE
Navigate to src/voting/voting.ino
Select the correct board and COM port
Click Upload
Test the system by following the LCD instructions
